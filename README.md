# React-Hooks-Demo

This repo contains code from the blog post [5 Ways to convert react class components to functional components with hooks](https://scotch.io/tutorials/5-ways-to-convert-react-class-components-to-functional-components-w-react-hooks)

The blog posts discuses how to refactor 5 types of React component classes to have the same behavior with Hooks

In class we will mount the component to App, view the code and discuss how it works 

## Scenario 1 : Class without state or lifecycle methods
## Scenario 2 : Class with state
## Scenario 3 : Class with multiple state properties
## Scenario 4 : Class with state and componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
## Scenario 5 : Class with state, componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate

Next we will go to another blog [Why react hooks and how did we get here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-react-hooks-and-how-did-we-even-get-here-aa5ed5dc96af) to understand 
- The benefits of using Hooks as opposed to classes in your new components. 
- Some rules we need to keep in mind when using Hooks
